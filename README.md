# CS50's Database with SQL

## Project Objective
This is CS50’s introduction to databases using SQL. I undertook this project to learn more about SQL from THE best University in the world. In this project, I learned beginner and intermediate levels of query language using SQL. I learnt how to create, read, update, and delete data with relational databases, which store data in rows and columns. Furthermore, I learned how to model real-world entities and relationships among them using tables with appropriate types, triggers, and constraints. Learn how to normalize data to eliminate redundancies and reduce the potential for errors. Learnt how to automate searches with views and expedite searches with indexes, and finally how to connect SQL with other language like Python and Java. Course begins with SQLite for portability’s sake and ends with introductions to PostgreSQL and MySQL for scalability’s sake as well.



## Problem Set 0
- Tables. Databases. Database Management Systems. SQL. SQLite. SELECT. LIMIT. OFFSET. WHERE. Comparisons. NOT. NULL. Pattern Matching. LIKE. Compound Conditions. Range Conditions. Ordering. Aggregate Functions. ROUND. DISTINCT.

## Problem Set 1
- Relational Databases. Relationships: One-to-one, One-to-many, Many-to-many. Entity Relationship Diagrams. Keys: Primary Keys, Foreign Keys. Subqueries. IN. Joins: INNER JOIN, Outer Joins, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, NATURAL JOIN. Sets: INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT. Groups: GROUP BY, HAVING.

## Problem Set 2
- Schemas. Normalizing. Data Types. Storage Classes. Type Affinities. Table Constraints: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY. Column Constraints: CHECK, DEFAULT, NOT NULL, UNIQUE. Altering Tables: DROP TABLE, ALTER TABLE, ADD COLUMN, RENAME COLUMN, DROP COLUMN. Charlie.

## Problem Set 3
- Create, Read, Update, Delete. INSERT INTO. CSVs. .import. DELETE FROM. Foreign Key Constraints. UPDATE. Triggers. Soft Deletions.

## Problem Set 4
- Views. CREATE VIEW. Views for Simplifying. Views for Aggregating. Temporary Views. CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW. Common Table Expressions. Views for Partitioning. Views for Securing. Soft Deletions.

## Problem Set 5
Indexes. CREATE INDEX. EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN. Covering Indexes. B-Trees. Partial Indexes. VACUUM. Concurrency. Transactions. ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. BEGIN TRANSACTION. COMMIT. ROLLBACK. Race Conditions. Locks.

## Problem Set 6
- Scalability. MySQL: Integers, Strings, Dates, Times, Real Numbers, Floating-Point Imprecision, Fixed Precision, Altering Tables. Stored Procedures. PostgreSQL. Vertical Scaling. Horizontal Scaling. Replication. Read Replicas. Sharding. Access Controls: GRANT, REVOKE. SQL Injection Attacks. Prepared Statements.

## Final Project
- The final project involves creating a custom SQL database that addresses a meaningful problem or fulfills a purpose you find interesting. You can work individually or in a group of up to three, with group projects requiring proportional increases in scope. The project consists of three deliverables:

DESIGN.md

A design document detailing the purpose, scope, entities, relationships, optimizations, and limitations of your database.
Must include an entity relationship diagram and a 3-minute video overview.
schema.sql

Contains SQL statements defining the database schema (e.g., tables, indexes, views).
queries.sql

Includes common SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) that users might run on the database.
