--A parent asks you for advice on finding the best public school districts in Massachusetts. In 12.sql, write a SQL query to find public school districts with above-average per-pupil expenditures and an above-average percentage of teachers rated “exemplary”. Your query should return the districts’ names, along with their per-pupil expenditures and percentage of teachers rated exemplary. Sort the results first by the percentage of teachers rated exemplary (high to low), then by the per-pupil expenditure (high to low).

SELECT "districts"."name", "expenditures"."per_pupil_expenditure", "staff_evaluations"."exemplary"
FROM "districts"
JOIN "expenditures" ON "expenditures"."district_id" = "districts"."id"
JOIN "staff_evaluations" ON "staff_evaluations"."district_id" = "districts"."id"
WHERE "districts"."type" LIKE "Public School%" AND "per_pupil_expenditure" >= (
    SELECT AVG("per_pupil_expenditure")
    FROM "expenditures"
) AND "exemplary" >= (
    SELECT AVG("exemplary")
    FROM "staff_evaluations"
)
ORDER BY "exemplary" DESC, "per_pupil_expenditure" DESC;
